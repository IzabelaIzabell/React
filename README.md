# Cartoon game CatchMe!
This is my first project in React. The game is already deployed as a website in Netlify and it's availble under following link



Choose your character and save or manipulate people from the cave! After the game starts, you have 30 seconds to click on a person and collect points for that. Be careful - people don’t trust you, no matter which side you choose and it’s not easy to click on them!
